#Form follows ~~function~~ failure

"Form follows function" is the definition of good design for many people. However, if you look at how most objects we take for granted got their shape, you'll see that form doesn't follow function. Rather, it follows failure.

"Form follows function" matches the myth of the Eureka moment of an inventor, but not the way invention really occurs.

There is no single function for an object to perform, and there is no single form. The history of objects we take for granted is evidence of this. No object is made in a vacum. Most things respond to their pre-decessors and improve them. The process of invention is evolutionary, not creationary.
