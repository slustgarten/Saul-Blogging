I'd been hesitant to read this book for a while as I thought it would be redundant with Charles Duhigg's "The Power of Habit". 

Even thought there are certainly overlaps, Atomic Habits is much more tactical with a focus on helping you change your habits. 
My main takeaways from the book are:

- Systems > Goals: I originally read this on Scott Adams' "How to fail at everything and still win big" and love it. "You don't rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems".
- Be mindful of your habits. Once they develop we stop paying attention. Pointing and calling can raise your awareness from a non-concious habit to a concious one.

### If you want to change behavior, make it obvious and easy to do so. 
- Time and place are two of the most common cues. An implementation intention is a strategy for pairing a new habit with a location/time. The formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].
- Habit stacking lets you pair a new habit with an existing one. The formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT] I will [NEW HABIT]
- Make cures of good habits obvious in your environment. 
- Make the cues that trigger habits stand out and obvious in your environment so that eventually the context of your environment becomes the cue. This also applies to changing a current habit - changing the environment might help. For example, if you're trying to eat healthier, try a new grocery store so you're not on autopilot when purchasing food.
- If you want to get rid of a habit, make it invisible. Don't rely on self-control. Remove the temptation, avoid exposure to the cue that causes it. 

### If you want to adopt a behavior, make it attractive
- Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Anticipation of the reward is what gets us to take action. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation. 
- Temptation bundling is a strategy to make habits more attractive: pair an action you *want* to do with an action you *need* to do.
- Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. It is more effective if you already have something in common with the group. 
  - If a hebavior gets us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.
- Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.
- To change a behavior you can make it unattractive. Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit by making it seem unattractive.

### If you want to adopt a behavior, make it easy
- Habit formation is process by which behavior becomes progressively more automativ through repetition. 
- Amount of time you've been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you've done it.
- Behavior follows the law of least effort, We gravitate toward the option that requires least amount of work.
- Reduce friction for good behaviors, and increase it for bad ones.
- Prime your environment to make future actions easier (ie keep healthy snacks around, don't buy unhealthy ones, etc)
- Start small: When you start a new habit it should take less than 2 minutes to do.
- Standardize a habit before you optimize it (you can't improve something that doesn't exists).
- The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into deep focus.
- Use commitment devices to lock better behavior in the future. For example, give money to a cause you despise to keep you honest.
- Ultimate way to lock future behavior is by automating you habits. Invest in tech and one time purchases that lock in future behavior (for example, buy a better mattress to sleep better).

### If you want a habit to stick, make it satisfying
- We're more likely to repeat behaviors is the experience is satisfying.
- What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished, is avoided.
- To get a habit to stick, you need to feel succesful (even if on a small way).
- Feeling of making progress is one of the most satisfying feelins. 
- Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can be a good way to leverage this insight to foster a good habit.
  - Don't break the chain. Seinfeld keeps on writing by marking an X on a calendar for every day he writes a joke. He is motivated by avoiding to break the chain.
- Never miss twice. If you miss one day of a habit, get back on it as soon as possible.
- If you want to break a behavior, make it unsatisfying. 
  - Accountability partners can create an immediate cost to inaction. 
  - Habit contracts can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It makes the cost of breaking a promise public and painful. 
  - Knowing someone is watching you can be a powerful motivator.

### Some additional tips
- As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying - we get bored. 
- Boredom is ultimately the threat to success because we lose our motivation to work hard.
- Professionals stick to a schedule. Amateurs let life get in the way.
- Habits + Deliberate practice = mastery


I found the book to be a good compilation on the research and stories around the science of habit, with good tips and techniques. The book is written in a way that makes it easy to digest and skim, with good summaries after every chapter, so I encourage you to read it if you're interested in behavior change (I think it's relevant for self-improvement, but it can also be leveraged if you work on product or marketing). It's a good companion to Duhigg's book, which focuses more on the science rather than habit hacks. 

Below are the raw unedited notes in case you want to take a sneak peek....

#### NOTES FROM: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, by James Clear

January 10, 2021
Introduction: My Story, p. 7
I had felt like an impostor when I began writing two years earlier, but now I was becoming known as an expert on habits—a new label that excited me but also felt uncomfortable

January 10, 2021
Introduction: My Story, p. 9
What I offer you is a synthesis of the best ideas smart people figured out a long time ago as well as the most compelling discoveries scientists have made recently

January 11, 2021
Introduction: My Story, p. 9
The backbone of this book is my four-step model of habits—cue, craving, response, and reward—and the four laws of behavior change that evolve out of these steps. Readers with a psychology background may recognize some of these terms from operant conditioning, which was first proposed as “stimulus, response, reward” by B. F. Skinner in the 1930s and has been popularized more recently as “cue, routine, reward” in The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg

January 11, 2021
Introduction: My Story, p. 9
Skinner’s model did an excellent job of explaining how external stimuli influenced our habits, it lacked a good explanation for how our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs impact our behavior. Internal states—our moods and emotions—matter, too. In recent decades, scientists have begun to determine the connection between our thoughts, feelings, and behavior

1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits, p. 21
Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees. When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success

January 13, 2021
1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits, p. 15
It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis

January 13, 2021
1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits, p. 15
Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero

January 13, 2021
1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits, p. 16
Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement

January 13, 2021
1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits, p. 17
Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations

January 13, 2021
1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits, p. 18
You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results

January 13, 2021
1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits, p. 18
Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits

January 13, 2021
1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits, p. 20
habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance

January 13, 2021
1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits, p. 22
The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us. And the task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time

January 13, 2021
1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits, p. 23
FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD

January 13, 2021
1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits, p. 23
Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results

January 13, 2021
1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits, p. 24
Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems

January 13, 2021
1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits, p. 25
When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level.

January 13, 2021
1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits, p. 26
The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone

January 13, 2021
1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits, p. 26
When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision

January 13, 2021
1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits, p. 26
When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it

January 13, 2021
1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits, p. 27
The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game

January 13, 2021
1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits, p. 27
This is the meaning of the phrase atomic habits—a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth

2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa), p. 39
It is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins

January 13, 2021
2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa), p. 30
Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe

January 13, 2021
2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa), p. 31
The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become

January 13, 2021
2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa), p. 33
The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it

January 13, 2021
2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa), p. 34
True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity.

January 13, 2021
2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa), p. 34
Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are—either consciously or nonconsciously.* Research has shown that once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief

January 13, 2021
2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa), p. 35
The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it

January 13, 2021
2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa), p. 36
Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way. This is why you can’t get too attached to one version of your identity

January 13, 2021
2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa), p. 36
Your identity emerges out of your habits

January 13, 2021
2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa), p. 36
More precisely, your habits are how you embody your identity

January 13, 2021
2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa), p. 36
The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior

January 13, 2021
2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa), p. 37
Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness

January 13, 2021
2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa), p. 38
The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do

January 13, 2021
2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa), p. 40
Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?” The first step is not what or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be

January 13, 2021
2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa), p. 41
There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change. The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become. Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.

The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious. The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive. The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy. The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying. We can invert these laws to learn how to break a bad habit. How to Break a Bad Habit Inversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible. Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive. Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult. Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying

January 13, 2021
3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps, p. 54
Whenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply ask yourself: How can I make it obvious? How can I make it attractive? How can I make it easy? How can I make it satisfying?

January 13, 2021
3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps, p. 55
Chapter Summary A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic. The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible. Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying

A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic

January 13, 2021
3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps, p. 45
As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases

January 13, 2021
3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps, p. 46
Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience

January 13, 2021
3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps, p. 46
Whenever possible, the conscious mind likes to pawn off tasks to the nonconscious mind to do automatically. This is precisely what happens when a habit is formed. Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.

January 13, 2021
3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps, p. 47
The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward

January 13, 2021
3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps, p. 47
First, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward.

January 13, 2021
3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps, p. 48
Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire—without craving a change—we have no reason to act. What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers

January 13, 2021
3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps, p. 48
The third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the behavior

January 13, 2021
3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps, p. 49
Finally, the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal of every habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us

January 13, 2021
3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps, p. 49
rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future

January 13, 2021
3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps, p. 49
Rewards close the feedback loop and complete the habit cycle

January 13, 2021
3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps, p. 49
If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit

January 13, 2021
3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps, p. 50
In summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue. Together, these four steps form a neurological feedback loop—cue, craving, response, reward; cue, craving, response, reward—that ultimately allows you to create automatic habits. This cycle is known as the habit loop.

January 13, 2021
3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps, p. 51
We can split these four steps into two phases: the problem phase and the solution phase. The problem phase includes the cue and the craving, and it is when you realize that something needs to change. The solution phase includes the response and the reward, and it is when you take action and achieve the change you desire

January 13, 2021
4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right, p. 61
you don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it. This is what makes habits useful. It’s also what makes them dangerous.

January 13, 2021
4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right, p. 66
Chapter Summary With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing. The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them. Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions. The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.

January 13, 2021
4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right, p. 62
As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate

January 13, 2021
4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right, p. 63
This process, known as Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes. It seems silly, but it works incredibly well. Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent.

January 13, 2021
4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right, p. 63
Pointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level

January 13, 2021
4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right, p. 65
There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits. That is, effective at solving problems. All habits serve you in some way—even the bad ones—which is why you repeat them

January 13, 2021
4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right, p. 65
Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?” Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad.

January 13, 2021
4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right, p. 66
Hearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences seem more real. It adds weight to the action rather than letting yourself mindlessly slip into an old routine

5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit, p. 74
When it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.

5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit, p. 74
Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a current habit. This method, which was created by BJ Fogg as part of his Tiny Habits program, can be used to design an obvious cue for nearly any habit

Every habit should have a home. If you can manage to stick with this strategy, each context will become associated with a particular habit and mode of thought. Habits thrive under predictable circumstances like these

January 15, 2021
6: Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More, p. 90
Chapter Summary Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time. Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out. Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment. Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue. It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.

Hawkins Stern described a phenomenon he called Suggestion Impulse Buying, which “is triggered when a shopper sees a product for the first time and visualizes a need for it.” In other words, customers will occasionally buy products not because they want them but because of how they are presented to them

creating obvious visual cues can draw your attention toward a desired habit. In the early 1990s, the cleaning staff at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam installed a small sticker that looked like a fly near the center of each urinal. Apparently, when men stepped up to the urinals, they aimed for what they thought was a bug. The stickers improved their aim and significantly reduced “spillage” around the urinals. Further analysis determined that the stickers cut bathroom cleaning costs by 8 percent per year

7: The Secret to Self-Control, p. 95
Chapter Summary The inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it invisible. Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten. People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it. Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.

When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals aren’t all that different from those who are struggling. Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations

7: The Secret to Self-Control, p. 95
Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. You may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it’s unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment. This is the secret to self-control. Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.

Chapter Summary The 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive. The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act. It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike. Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.

in 1954 when the neuroscientists James Olds and Peter Milner ran an experiment that revealed the neurological processes behind craving and desire. By implanting electrodes in the brains of rats, the researchers blocked the release of dopamine. To the surprise of the scientists, the rats lost all will to live. They wouldn’t eat. They wouldn’t have sex. They didn’t crave anything. Within a few days, the animals died of thirst

other scientists also inhibited the dopamine-releasing parts of the brain, but this time, they squirted little droplets of sugar into the mouths of the dopamine-depleted rats. Their little rat faces lit up with pleasurable grins from the tasty substance. Even though dopamine was blocked, they liked the sugar just as much as before; they just didn’t want it anymore. The ability to experience pleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And without desire, action stopped.

Chapter Summary The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us. We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe. We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige). One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group. The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves. If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive

The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. For example, one study found that when a chimpanzee learns an effective way to crack nuts open as a member of one group and then switches to a new group that uses a less effective strategy, it will avoid using the superior nut cracking method just to blend in with the rest of the chimps

Chapter Summary The inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it unattractive. Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper underlying motive. Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them. The prediction leads to a feeling.

The more you repeat an activity, the more the structure of your brain changes to become efficient at that activity.

Chapter Summary Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward. Many habits occur at decisive moments—choices that are like a fork in the road—and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one. The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things.

Chapter Summary The 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying. We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards. The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided. To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful—even if it’s in a small way. The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time.

avoiding a 33 percent loss is just as valuable as achieving a 50 percent gain. As Charlie Munger says, “The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily.” This is why the “bad” workouts are often the most important ones. Sluggish days and bad workouts maintain the compound gains you accrued from previous good days

Chapter Summary One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress. A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—like marking an X on a calendar. Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress. Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive. Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible. Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing

One study of more than sixteen hundred people found that those who kept a daily food log lost twice as much weight as those who did not. The mere act of tracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it

January 16, 2021
16: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day, p. 198
In summary, habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and don’t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you record another successful instance of your habit. Furthermore, habit tracking provides visual proof that you are casting votes for the type of person you wish to become, which is a delightful form of immediate and intrinsic gratification

The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.

It’s easy to train when you feel good, but it’s crucial to show up when you don’t feel like it—even if you do less than you hope. Going to the gym for five minutes may not improve your performance, but it reaffirms your identity

This is sometimes referred to as Goodhart’s Law. Named after the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you

January 16, 2021
16: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day, p. 204
No matter how you measure your improvement, habit tracking offers a simple way to make your habits more satisfying. Each measurement provides a little bit of evidence that you’re moving in the right direction and a brief moment of immediate pleasure for a job well done

17: How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything, p. 210
Chapter Summary The inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it unsatisfying. We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying. An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us. A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful. Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator

January 16, 2021
17: How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything, p. 206
Just as we are more likely to repeat an experience when the ending is satisfying, we are also more likely to avoid an experience when the ending is painful

January 16, 2021
17: How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything, p. 208
A habit contract is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow through. Then you find one or two people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract with you

The most proven scientific analysis of personality traits is known as the “Big Five,” which breaks them down into five spectrums of behavior. Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end to cautious and consistent on the other. Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing and spontaneous. Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved (you likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts). Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached. Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, and stable. All five characteristics have biological underpinnings

Chapter Summary The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition. Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle. Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances. Habits are easier when they align with your natural abilities. Choose the habits that best suit you. Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can’t find a game that favors you, create one. Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on

18: The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don’t), p. 218
The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition. This is just as true with habit change as it is with sports and business. Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with, when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities

Flow is the mental state you enter when you are so focused on the task at hand that the rest of the world fades away. This blend of happiness and peak performance is what athletes and performers experience when they are “in the zone.” It is nearly impossible to experience a flow state and not find the task satisfying at least to some degree

Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind Dilbert, says, “Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort. In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And I’m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.”

the way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of “just manageable difficulty.” The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty

As Machiavelli noted, “Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.” Perhaps this is why many of the most habit-forming products are those that provide continuous forms of novelty

19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work, p. 237
Chapter Summary The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying. We get bored. Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference. Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way

A flow state is the experience of being “in the zone” and fully immersed in an activity. Scientists have tried to quantify this feeling. They found that to achieve a state of flow, a task must be roughly 4 percent beyond your current ability

But this coach was saying that really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom

In psychology, this is known as a variable reward

January 16, 2021
19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work, p. 235
Variable rewards won’t create a craving—that is, you can’t take a reward people are uninterested in, give it to them at a variable interval, and hope it will change their mind—but they are a powerful way to amplify the cravings we already experience because they reduce boredom

January 16, 2021
19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work, p. 235
You need just enough “winning” to experience satisfaction and just enough “wanting” to experience desire. This is one of the benefits of following the Goldilocks Rule. If you’re already interested in a habit, working on challenges of just manageable difficulty is a good way to keep things interesting

January 16, 2021
19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work, p. 235
Variable rewards or not, no habit will stay interesting forever. At some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self-improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom

The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it. One solution is to avoid making any single aspect of your identity an overwhelming portion of who you are. In the words of investor Paul Graham, “keep your identity small.” The more you let a single belief define you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you

Tao Te Ching encapsulates the ideas perfectly: Men are born soft and supple; dead, they are stiff and hard. Plants are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry. Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life.

Chapter Summary The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors. Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time. The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.

Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development. Old tasks become easier the second time around, but it doesn’t get easier overall because now you’re pouring your energy into the next challenge. Each habit unlocks the next level of performance. It’s an endless cycle

I know of executives and investors who keep a “decision journal” in which they record the major decisions they make each week, why they made them, and what they expect the outcome to be.

Conclusion: The Secret to Results That Last, p. 252
Sometimes a habit will be hard to remember and you’ll need to make it obvious. Other times you won’t feel like starting and you’ll need to make it attractive. In many cases, you may find that a habit will be too difficult and you’ll need to make it easy. And sometimes, you won’t feel like sticking with it and you’ll need to make it satisfying.
