## The Upside of Stress

The upside of stress argues that embracing stress is a healthier approach than avoiding it and attempting to reduce it. Quoting numerous scientific studies, the book shows how stress has positive effects and can help us better cope with challenges in our lives. The book starts with some mind-blowing research about mindsets showing that how you view 

## Book Notes

### Intro

- Stress increases chances of dying by 43%.
- Stress on its own is not to blame but also the belief that stress is bad for you.
- People who didn’t view stress as harmful had lower risk of stress than people who didn’t report having stress. 
- How you think about stress matters.
- Some beliefs can influence longevity. Positive attitude about aging makes you live longer (yale study lived average 7.8 years lobger). Excercise, healthy blood pressure etc adds less than 4 years. Those who believe most people can be trusted live longer than cynical view of human nature.
- Fear stigma etc don’t really help motivate people to the right behavior. This is why a lot of public policies backfire.
- Stress can make you smarter stronger and more successful. Changing your mind about stress can make you healthier and happier.
- Best way to manage stress is to embrace it. Get better at stressing.
- Stress is a catch all word. 
- In the book it is defined as: Stress is what arises when something you care about is at stake.

### Part 1 - rethink stress

Chapter 1 - How to change your mind about stress
- How to change your mind about stress
- How you think about something can transform its effect on you. 
- Crumb (columbia business school researcher). 
- Mindsets are beliefs that shape your reality. The effect you expect is what you get.
- Crumb asked howsekeepers if they excercise and most said no even though housekeeping is strenous. She designed a poster to show housekeepers in hotels how housekeeping is physical workout. Those who were informed their jobs was working out lost weight and had better blood pressure than before. All crumb did was change their perception. Her hypothesis is that when 2 outcomes are possible (physical strain or health benefits of exercise), perceptions influence the outcome. 
- Shake tasting study - milkshake labeled indulgence and nutritional label showing lots of calories and fat. They also had a shake with better label sensi shake and less calories. They measured blood levels lf ghrelin (hunger hormone). Indulgence shake had bigger drop on ghrelin than the sensi shake. But it was the same shake. The only change was the beliefs. Ghrelin dropped 3x more when they thought it was indulgent than diet drink. Expectations can alter something as concrete as ghrelin.
- Perceptions change body response.  The same applies to stress. If you view it as beneficial or harmful. 
- Two stress hormones: cortisol and dhea.
- Cortisol turns sugar and fat into energy. Suppresses bio functions less useful during stress, such as reproduction, digestion and growth.
- DHEA is a neurosteroid. Hormone that helps brain grow stronger from stressful experiences and counters some of the effects of cortisol.
- You need both. But the ratio can influence the long term conseqence of stress. Higher corrisol can lead to worse outcomes. DHEA can reduce adverse impact of stress. 
- Growth index of stress response = dhea to cortisol ratio. High index helps people thrive (predicts academic resilience, higher gpa, greater focus in military situations, less ptsd, problem solving). 
- Changing people’s perception of stress changed the ratio of cortisol to dhea in Crum’s experiment. Viewing stress as enhancing and helpful made it so.
- Mindset effect is different from placebo in that it lasts longer and snowballs. 
- Mindset is a belief that biases how you think feel and act. Its loke a filter through which you view life. They are core beliefs about the way the world works, reflect a philosophy of life.
- How does mindset affect growing older? One explanation is that a positive view of old age makes you more likely to take care of your health and have a will to live, go to the doctor, etc. 
- Mindset of stress can affect if you thrive under it or not.
- Crum considered the hypothesis that people with positive mindset on stress had easier lives and didn’t find meaningful corration. Also positive mindset helped even if person was not under a lot of stress. She also considered if optimism was to blame and though there was a small correlation two other traits were more important: mindfulness and ability to tolerate uncertainty.
- A better explanation is that if you have negative view of stress, you will try to avoid it and escape it. If you have a positive view you will face it heads on and try to work out whatever is causing you stress.
- Greg Walton from stanford is a master at changing mindsets with brief interventions
- One mindset intervention he did was to affect belonging of freshmen in ivy league school. His intervention showed people that everyone struggles at school at some point. He showed it to african american students. Those who received it performed better than those who didn’t and it closed the gpa gap between african americans and their peers. Interestingly at the end of college they didn’t even remember the intervention - but on average the mindset changes it has positive effects even if you don’t remember it.
- Changing out minds can be a catalyst for all the other things we want to change in our lives.
- Placebos work even if you tell subjects they are having a placebo, but you explain that placebos can be powerful (if your mindset towards placebos is that they are real).
- Open label placebo experiments show patients can some times have better improvements than if they took the real drug.
- Mindset interventions, like placebos, work even if you tell the subjects that you are trying to change their minds. 
- Mindset intervention is less about manipulation than about choice - you choose to see things differently.
- Mindset interventions work best when you learn the new point of view, are given exercises that encourages to learn and apply the new mindset, and sharing learning with others.
- Practice mindset mindfulness to see how you view stress (and other beliefs). How does it make you feel? How do you react?
- Instead of complaining about stress be excited about it.
